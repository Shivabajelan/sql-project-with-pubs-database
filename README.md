# SQL Project with Pubs Database 📚

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is part of my hands-on SQL learning journey. I'm currently taking a SQL course and using the classic **Pubs** sample database from Microsoft to practise concepts, write queries, and explore real-world database scenarios.

## 🧾 About the Project

The **Pubs** database represents a fictional book publishing company and includes data about:
- Authors
- Books (titles)
- Publishers
- Sales
- Store locations

It’s a great dataset for applying SQL skills in a structured yet realistic context.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo is organised by topic or concept. Each folder contains `.sql` files with example queries and exercises. I add comments to explain what each query does and why I used certain approaches.
