# SQL Project with Pubs Database 📚

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is part of my hands-on SQL learning journey. I'm currently taking a SQL course and using the classic **Pubs** sample database from Microsoft to practise concepts, write queries, and explore real-world database scenarios.

## 🧾 About the Project

The **Pubs** database represents a fictional book publishing company and includes data about:
- Authors
- Books (titles)
- Publishers
- Sales
- Store locations

It’s a great dataset for applying SQL skills in a structured yet realistic context.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo is organised by topic or concept. Each folder contains `.sql` files with example queries and exercises. I add comments to explain what each query does and why I used certain approaches.

/Joins

inner_joins.sql

left_joins.sql /Aggregates

groupby_examples.sql

avg_max_min.sql /LinkedServers

remote_query_examples.sql /LearningLogs

## 🧠 Topics I'm Exploring

- Table design and relationships
- Data exploration and filtering
- Joins (inner, left, right, full)
- Aggregation functions
- Subqueries
- Views
- Linked Servers
- Writing clear and efficient SQL queries

## 💬 Why I Built This

As an aspiring data analyst, I believe in learning by doing. This repo helps me:
- Practice real SQL skills
- Document my growth
- Share my work with others
- Stay consistent and motivated

Recently, I even created a **Linked Server** on my own system (using my IP) so I could simulate cross-server querying — it felt like connecting two worlds together! 🌍

## 🛠️ Tools

- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Git + GitHub
