# SQL Project with Pubs Database

This SQL project explores the classic Microsoft **Pubs** sample database. It features a collection of queries and scripts designed to demonstrate core SQL skills through real-world scenarios.

## 📌 Overview

The project focuses on essential SQL concepts, including:

- Data retrieval using `SELECT` statements
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN`
- Sorting and ordering data
- Table joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Aggregation using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Working with **Linked Servers** in SQL Server

The aim is to provide clear, practical examples of how SQL can be used to explore and analyze relational data in a structured and meaningful way.
